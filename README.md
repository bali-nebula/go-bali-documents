## Go Bali Documents

### Overview
This project provides a powerful framework for manipulating documents containing
Bali Document Notation™ ("Bali" for short).  It integrates the classes found in the
[go-component-framework](https://github.com/craterdog/go-component-framework)
with "smart" versions of the classes that were generated in the
[go-document-notation](https://github.com/bali-nebula/go-document-notation)
project.
